At such time we may request certain PII such as name, email address and demographic information (such as zip code, age, or income level). In some of our emails we may use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Sites. When Users click one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We may track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our communications.
How do we use the information you provide us? GMB uses information for the following general purposes:

We may share PII or other information we collect with the Sponsors who may have their own privacy policy significantly different from ours.
We may use any of the information under our control in order to improve, or to better understand how our products or services are used.
We may use your PII to contact you in order to answer a question or address a concern that you've raised, or to provide customer service on your Account.
We may use your PII to conduct research by sending you a survey.
We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your Account, such as service announcements and administrative messages.
We may share information collected including your PII with our agents, representatives, contractors and service providers so they can provide us with support services such as e-mail origination, support services and customer relationship management services.
Unless you opt-out, we may use your e-mail or other PII to send commercial or marketing messages without your further consent.  Be advised that we use your e-mail address and other contact information provided by you to contact you regarding your Submissions.  We may also use your e-mail address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Sites or Service changes or customer service purposes).
You may opt-out of receiving commercial emails from us at any time by using the unsubscribe links provided in our emails.
We use both your PII and certain non-PII (such as anonymous user data, IP addresses, browser type, click stream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Site, Application and Services and to create new features, promotions, functionality and services by storing, tracking, analyzing and processing User preferences and trends, as well as User activity and communications.

Our Services connect with and rely on various third party websites and Sports Bars. In an attempt to provide increased value to our Users, we may also choose to link to and connect with various third party web sites and Sports Bars. We also may participate in co-branding and other relationships to offer other services and features to our Users. We have no control over these linked sites and third parties, each of which has separate privacy and data collection practices independent of us.  We encourage you to read the policies of these third party websites and Sports Bars. By engaging with third party websites, Sports Bars, services and tools through our Site, Application and Services, you consent to our providing your PII to those third parties. Data collected by the Sports Bars or third party websites (even if offered on or through our Site or Application) may not be received by us. As such, we have no responsibility or liability for the independent policies or actions of third parties, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such website or services. These linked sites, Sports Bars, services and tools are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our services and therefore request any feedback.

Further, any linking with any other website or Sports Bars is neither an endorsement of that website or Sports Bar nor any of the products or services that may be offered by them.

Note:  Your PII may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets of GMB or a bankruptcy. We may also disclose PII or financial information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law, to cooperate with law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of GMB or other Users of the Site, Application or Services.  Whenever PII is disclosed under this paragraph, we may also disclose your demographic information on a non-anonymous basis.
How does GMB Protect Users Personal Information?  We implement a variety of security measures to ensure the security of your PII on our systems.  When you enter sensitive information, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Please be aware that emails or other messages you send to us are not necessarily secure against interception and you should not include sensitive information in those messages. We generally will not ask for your password or other sensitive information in an email and you should assume that if you get such a request, it might be fraudulent.

Except for SSL transmissions, the Sites are not encrypted. Access to your Account profile is restricted by your password.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your PII, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Third parties may unlawfully attempt to intercept or access transmissions or private communications.  Although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications would always remain private.

7.  Individuals under 13 years of age.
Pursuant to the provisions of the 1998 Federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), our policy is to refuse individuals under 13 years of age access to the Site, Application and Services.  We therefore do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under 13 years of age.
Does GMB Use Cookies? We use "cookies" (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your computer, mobile phone, or other device) provided though our analytics services to analyze the Site’s performance and improve our Services.
How do you change PII provided or OPT-OUT?  GMB may provide its registered Users with an option for modifying or removing some of the information that it has about them from its database. This limited option may be accomplished by altering information Submitted to your profile or Account. Please note that we require some PII in order to provide you with access to competitions sponsored by Sports Bars. If you wish to delete certain PII required for Account maintenance such as your name or e-mail address, you may be required to terminate your Account.  However, please note, that while such a tool may be provided now or in the future, you acknowledge that we may retain archived or cached copies of your PII. The above not withstanding, please note that not all PII monitored, stored, tracked or submitted to us shall be controllable by Users and may not be removed from the Application or our Services.

How Long Do We Keep your Information? Except as otherwise provided, User’s PII is maintained by us for as long as it is needed to provide you with access to our Services or as long as you maintain an Account, which ever is longer.
By visiting or using the Site, Application or Services, you consent to the collection and use of information by us as set forth in this Privacy Policy.  If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes within this page so Users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
Be sure to review our Privacy Policy, Terms of Services and any rules regularly so that you will be aware of any changes to them.  Please remember that your continued use of this Site, Application or Services, and/or maintenance of an Account after changes or revisions have been made constitute your acceptance of such updates.
